{"name":"Kanibhelper","tagline":"Automatic Nib handling for 3.5 and 4 inches screens","body":"# KANibHelper\r\n\r\nTired of autolayout and those damn constraints which lack simplicity and flexibility ? Well then this library is made for you. I believe having separate Nib files for 3.5 and 4 inches screens are the way to go if you want to ease up the layout management process and improve your app maintanability.\r\n\r\n## How to install\r\n\r\nSimply copy :\r\n * KAViewController.h\r\n * KAViewController.m\r\n\r\ninto your project folder and import KAViewController.h\r\n\r\nor use cocoapod with this line :\r\n    pod 'KANibHelper', :git => 'https://github.com/kirualex/KANibHelper.git'\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\n\r\nJust subclass `KAViewController` instead of the usual `UIViewController` in your header file, and you are ready to go !\r\n\r\nYou can then create a separate Nib file targeting 4 inches screen just by adding the suffix '~iphone4' to your original Nib file (don't forget to specify the class of the file owner and to link the views outlets).\r\nDon't worry if you don't have a specific '~iphone4' Nib for every screens of your app, KAViewController will just fallback on the default Nib for your controller.\r\nYou can also add the suffix '~iphone3_5' to your original nib for consistenc, it will work.\r\n\r\nCheck out the demo if you want to see the details, and don't hesitate to fork me !\r\n\r\n### File hierarchy example\r\n\r\n![Files](http://i.imgur.com/siMS57M.png)\r\n\r\n### Result\r\n\r\n![Result](http://i.imgur.com/imUMj0e.jpg)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
